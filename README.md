# kripkecheck
An intuitive tool to build Kripke models and assess made inquiries. 
The purpose of this application is to offer an intuitive tool to graphically create Kripke models. These models in turn allow inquiries to be made on them. Inspiration was drawn from homework assignments for the Multi Agent Systems course at the University of Groningen. These assignments required students to draw several Kripke models. When using pen and paper one is able to quickly draw a Kripke model, but is limited by its abilities to correct mistakes. Using digital software to create Kripke models is tedious, but does offer some flexibility. This tool offers the best of both worlds; fast iteration and flexibility. As such this tool aims to reduce human error when analyzing Kripke models. [Try a live version here!](https://olafvisker.bitbucket.io/Logic%20Solver/)
